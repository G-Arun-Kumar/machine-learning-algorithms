Which model should I apply for my dataset?\n\n**Answer-** In short, apply the model selection technique in all the models, compare the R^2 value and choose the best one. We have learnt about the R^2 value in previous tutorial(another notebook) formula & explanation is available. Just reiterrating here, better our model, smaller will be the SSreg(regression sum of squares) and larger will be the R^2 value. It means, the R^2 value **closer to 1 are with greater performance model**.\n\nWe have a function called **r2_score** from the module **metrics** from sklearn library. This **r2_score** function helps to identify the performace of the model and find the R^2 value. By comparing this R^2 value of every model, we can choose the best model.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing r2_score method from metrics class of sklearn library","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"Let's Import r2_score method from metrics class of sklearn library.
