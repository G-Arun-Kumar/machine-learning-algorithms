You can use NLP on an article to predict some categories of the articles you are trying to segment. You can use NLP on a book to predict the genre of the book. And it can go further, you can use NLP to build a machine translator or a speech recognition system, and in that last example you use classification algorithms to classify language. Speaking of classification algorithms, most of **NLP algorithms are classification models**, and they include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, CART which is a model based on decision trees, Maximum Entropy again related to Decision Trees, Hidden Markov Models which are models based on Markov processes.\n\nA very well-known model in NLP is the **Bag of Words model.** It is a model used to preprocess the texts to classify before fitting the classification algorithms on the observations containing the texts.\n\nIn the upcoming section we will be learning below concepts.\n\n**Types of Natural language processing**\n\n**Classical vs Deep Learning models**\n\n**Bag-Of-Words**","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}}]}
